### About

I created this application using cutting-edge technologies like NextJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. Initially, I utilized Sanity as a headless CMS to achieve outstanding results, but later decided to adopt a more streamlined deployment approach to improve efficiency. As a passionate tech enthusiast, I enjoy exploring and experimenting with emerging technologies, which is why I periodically rebuild my portfolio from scratch to showcase my skills and stay ahead of the curve. Although design was not my primary focus for this project, I dedicated all my efforts to ensuring that the functionality of the site is top-notch, making it both intuitive and advanced from a technical standpoint. Although I could have dedicated more time to refining the code, my plate is currently full with multiple side projects. Therefore, my priority was to get the application up and running rather than perfecting every detail.
